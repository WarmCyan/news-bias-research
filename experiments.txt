FROM THIS POINT NO BIAS EXPERIMENT IS USING SPIEGEL
NOTE: for all of below (if on cluster) run first one first
+ means no dependency on former?


To establish avg_std better than avg

bias_svm_w2v_avg
bias_svm_w2v_avg_std
bias_w2v_avg
bias_w2v_avg_std


To establish better selection set:

bias_svm_w2v_avg_std
bias_svm_w2v_avg_std_allsides_all
bias_svm_w2v_avg_std_mbm
bias_svm_w2v_avg_std_below20flip
bias_svm_w2v_avg_std_below25flip


To establish superior embedding:

bias_svm_tfidf
bias_svm_w2v_avg_std
bias_svm_glove_avg_std
bias_svm_ft_avg_std
bias_tfidf
bias_w2v_avg_std
bias_glove_avg_std
bias_ft_avg_std



To establish avg_std better than avg
"rel_avg"

rel_svm_w2v_avg (350)
rel_svm_w2v_avg_std (360)
rel_w2v_avg (300)
rel_w2v_avg_std (310)


To establish sentics with nn with reliability:

rel_w2v_avg
rel_w2v_avg_std
rel_w2v_limit_avg_std
rel_w2v_sentic_avg_std
rel_w2v_sentic_full_avg_std
