Base sequence reliability round: (9 experiments) [cluster]
------------------------
Establish from this whether sentic_full improves over sentic (if so, don't bother running limited sentic/embedding afterwards)

Experiments:
reliability_w2v_seq
reliability_glove_seq
reliability_ft_seq
reliability_w2v_sentic_seq
reliability_glove_sentic_seq
reliability_ft_sentic_seq
reliability_w2v_limit_seq
reliability_w2v_sentic_full_seq
reliability_sentic_seq


Base averages reliability round: (9 experiments) [local]
------------------------
Establish comparison of avg to seq (from last round), determine improvement of stddev (run remaining embedding types based on results of first two

Experiments:
reliability_tfidf
reliability_w2v_avg
reliability_w2v_avg_stddev
-if stddev better:
	reliability_sentic_avg_stddev
	reliability_glove_avg_stddev
	reliability_ft_avg_stddev
	-if sentic_full better:
		reliability_w2v_sentic_full_avg_stddev
		reliability_glove_sentic_full_avg_stddev
		reliability_ft_sentic_full_avg_stddev
