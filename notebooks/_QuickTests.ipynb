       "'In their anti-memo campaign, Democrats and their media allies shrilly insisted that publishing the memo (which turned out to contain no classified information) was recklessly irresponsible and a partisan act that undermines national security.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile they go on leaking classified information. This latest New York Times story openly publishes classified information whose only possible purpose is to...\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd of course it\\'s by David Kilpatrick.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s start with the headline. \"Secret alliance: Israel carries out airstrikes in Egypt, with Cairo\\'s okay\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNot quite true. But David Kilpatrick puts narrative ahead of accuracy. We\\'re talking about the northern Sinai here, not somewhere deep in Egypt. Under the Camp David Accords, Egypt isn\\'t really supposed to have military forces there. Israel gave Egypt an open door for deploying its forces to fight ISIS. If this story is true, Egypt is giving Israel its own open door to fight ISIS.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the headline telegraphs the agenda of undermining Egypt\\'s government (an act that can only benefit the Qatari-Iranian-Muslim Brotherhood alliance which the left has climbed into bed with.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more than two years, unmarked Israeli drones, helicopters and jets have carried out a covert air campaign, conducting more than 100 airstrikes inside Egypt, frequently more than once a week - and all with the approval of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. The remarkable cooperation marks a new stage in the evolution of their singularly fraught relationship. Once enemies in three wars, then antagonists in an uneasy peace, Egypt and Israel are now secret allies in a covert war against a common foe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat sounds good. But where is this information coming from?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can guess how many of those are Obama officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Times isn\\'t being coy about making clear that this is classified information. So why leak and publish this classified information? Why give that information to ISIS?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Israel, military censors restrict public reports of the airstrikes. It is unclear if any Israeli troops or special forces have set foot inside Egyptian borders, which would increase the risk of exposure. President El-Sissi has taken even more care, US officials say, to hide the origin of the strikes from all but a limited circle of military and intelligence officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that did no good, because the Obama regime had the information, and it\\'s been eavesdropping on everybody. Now elements of the Obama regime decided to drop the bomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Israeli role is having some unexpected consequences for the region, including on Middle East peace negotiations, in part by convincing senior Israeli officials that Egypt is now dependent on them even to control its own territory...  Both neighbours have sought to conceal Israel\\'s role in the airstrikes for fear of a backlash inside Egypt, where government officials and the state-controlled media continue to discuss Israel as a nemesis and pledge fidelity to the Palestinian cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the agenda here is to undermine Egypt\\'s government and keep pushing the narrative that Israel is too arrogant to make concessions to terrorists. And sure it helps ISIS, but that\\'s just more collateral damage in the campaign to support Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the media will pivot back to lecturing us about leaking classified information and putting party ahead of country.'"
